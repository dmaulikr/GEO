* MDZ: Reworked some of the sound effects. Launch weapon sound, hit sound.
* MDZ: Enemy will now hit you.
* MDZ: Added some code for a death animation, needs work.
* MDZ: Victory screen now plays music, doesn't fade out as nice as I'd like if you double tap to return to the map before it's finished.
* MDZ: Adding a basic main menu screen based off Johnny render.

* MDZ: Added a `#define` flag called RQAudioPlayerPlayAudioDuringDevelopment. Lets me/us have the app stay quite during development.
* MDZ: Added a flick threshold that will force the user to define the trajectory and velocity of the weapon before they pass the yellow line.
* MDZ: Added some basic perspective as the weapon passes the flick threshold it will shrink. Not sure how well it works visually. Feedback welcome.
