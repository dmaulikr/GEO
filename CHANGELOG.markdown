* MDZ: Added a `#define` flag called RQAudioPlayerPlayAudioDuringDevelopment. Lets me/us have the app stay quite during development.
* MDZ: Added a flick threshold that will force the user to define the trajectory and velocity of the weapon before they pass the yellow line.
* MDZ: Added some basic perspective as the weapon passes the flick threshold it will shrink. Not sure how well it works visually. Feedback welcome.
