	<p>GEO is a hybrid exercise tool / video game for the iPhone. The goal of GEO is to get you off the couch and moving!</p>
	
	<p>Using the GPS system in your iPhone, GEO will find your location on the map. When you start a workout it will then track and display distance traveled, calories burned and time elapsed. To help calculate the calorie burn GEO will also ask you for a recent weight.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Map.</strong> The <strong style="color:blue;">blue dot</strong> in the center is you. The <strong style="color:red;">red dots</strong> represent monsters. As you move around monsters will enter your circle of vision and come at you. The more monsters you <strong>fight</strong> the more <strong>experience</strong> you'll earn; which over time will unlock the true potential of your weapon and thus the <strong>ultimate final battle</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>As you walk around you will notice <strong style="color:blue;">treasures</strong> spawning in front of you. These treasures only last for a short while. Be sure to <strong>accelerate your pace</strong> to acquire them and restock the power of your glove.</p>

	<p><strong>Battles.</strong> During battles you will see a series of gems representing the four elements of the world: <strong style="color:red;">fire</strong>, <strong style="color:blue;">water</strong>, <strong style="color:green;">earth</strong> and <strong style="color:#9BB4C6;">air</strong>. Shoot these gems at monsters who would do you harm and remember everything has a weakness.</p>
	
	<p>When you first start your journey you will only have access to the <strong style="color:red;">fire</strong> weapon, but work hard and your will learn to master the full power of your glove, including its <strong style="color:blue;">shield</strong> capabilities.</p>
	
	<p>Live long, live strong and keep fighting for the good guys! <strong style="color:white;">Pepitoz!</strong></p>
