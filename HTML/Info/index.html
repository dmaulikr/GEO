	<h1>GEO</h1>
	<p>The GEO Map View will guide you around the GEO world lurking in your own neighborhood.  You are the blue dot inside of the clear circle on the map. 
		This circle represents the distance at which enemies, represented by red circles, will become aware of your location and begin to chase you. If you	outrun the enemy and they fall back outside of this circle, they will give up the chase.  If they catch you, you will be able to fight them</p>
	<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
	<p>Treasures will appear if you evade enemies long enough.  Treasures are represented by blue circles that will gradually disappear.  These treasures are only on the map a short time so you must hurry to acquire them.  A treasure will give your glove power a boost if you get to it in time.</p>
